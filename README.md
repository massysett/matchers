# matchers

This package contains helpers for performing text matches using
regular expressions as well as simpler matching that sees if a
particular substring exists within a larger string.

It was written mostly for use with
[Penny](http://www.github.com/massysett/penny) so it doesn't have much
of a stable API.

you have trouble building matchers, look there, as it will show you
what dependencies were successfully used in past builds.
